It's not what you think! Bored-af stands for Bored- and free!
A team of developers and I wanted to develop a web app that would cure people of being bored.
For example, have you ever had a day off work and didn't know what else to do with your day?
or you were hanging out with friends, however, none of you could decide on something to do?
INTRODUCING BORED-AF
-----------------------------
This web app pulls nearby events in your area such as food, music and movies! 
The app currently pulls events from an API that are happening on the current day that the user searches.
This was my first project working with a team of devlopers. The primary knowledge I took away from this
project was how to work as a team and evenly distribute work as needed.
